\section{Introduction} 


\subsection{The Tromsø Display Wall}
The Tromsø Display Wall consists of 28 computers each connected to a projector.
These projectors are mounted behind a canvas, projecting their content onto this
canvas. Together the projectors make up a display that has a resolution of 
7168x3072, and a physical size of 6x2m. In
addition to this Display Wall, we have also got a mobile wall with a slightly
smaller size and resolution. Both of these walls are used for
recruitment of high-school students, but also research at the department.
